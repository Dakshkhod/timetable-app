# üéØ **Immediate Next Steps - Railway to Mobile App**

## **üìç WHERE WE ARE NOW**
‚úÖ **Server deployed on Railway** (with minor warnings - but WORKING!)
‚è≥ **Need to get production URL and configure mobile app**

---

## **üöÄ NEXT 5 STEPS (Do These NOW)**

### **Step 1: Get Your Railway Production URL**
1. **Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/)**
2. **Click on your project**
3. **Look for the URL** (something like `https://smart-timetable-production-abc123.railway.app`)
4. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it!

### **Step 2: Test Your API**
**Open this URL in browser:**
```
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health
```
**You should see:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Smart Timetable Server is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T...",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### **Step 3: Add Missing Environment Variable**
**In Railway dashboard:**
1. **Go to "Variables"**
2. **Add new variable:**
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
   ```
3. **Save and redeploy**

### **Step 4: Update Mobile App Configuration**
**Edit `mobile-app/.env`:**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-existing-google-client-id
```

### **Step 5: Test Mobile App**
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start
```
**Then:**
1. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app on your phone
2. **Try registering a new account**
3. **Try logging in**
4. **Check if all features work**

## **üîç TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If API test fails:**
- Check Railway deployment status
- Look at Railway logs for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set

### **If mobile app can't connect:**
- Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is correct
- Check phone is on same network or using mobile data
- Test API URL directly in phone browser

### **If Google OAuth fails:**
- Update Google Cloud Console with Railway URL
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## **‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**You'll know it's working when:**
- [ ] Railway API responds at `/api/health`
- [ ] Mobile app connects to server
- [ ] You can register/login from mobile app
- [ ] Timetables load in mobile app
- [ ] All features work end-to-end

## **‚è≠Ô∏è AFTER SUCCESS**

**Once everything works:**
1. **Build production APK** (for Android)
2. **Submit to Google Play Store**
3. **Users can download your app!**
